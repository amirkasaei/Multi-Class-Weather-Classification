# Multi-Class-Weather-Classification

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to get familiar with Computer Vision and Image Processing, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Description
- In this project, we will use dataset [Multi-class Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratik2901/multiclass-weather-dataset).
- This data contains four classes Sunrise, Shine, Rain and Cloudy. Other information related to this data can be obtained in the relevant link.
- What we need to do is to design and implement deep convolutional neural networks to predict the type of weather. So our problem will be a 4-class image classification.

## Implemented Models
- Simple Convelutional Neural Network  
- [Resnet Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)
- [Inception Model v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842v1.pdf)
